## How it works

The PWM generates a 10 MHz PWM signal whose duty cycle can be adjusted using two buttons.
The PWM duty cycle can be increased or decreased in steps, constrained between 10% and 90%.

## How to test

Change the inputs ui_in to simulate button presses and check if the PWM duty cycle increases or decreases as expected.
